/** @file Bosch BME280 Virtual Device Shims
 *
 * This module implements the temperature, pressure/altitude, and humidity
 * virtual devices using the Bosch-provided BME280 driver.
 *
 * The expected usage pattern is as follows:
 * - Hardware platform initialization configures the BME280 driver according to
 *   the application's needs
 * - Hardware platform invokes initialize_bme280_virtual_devices(), passing the
 *   BME280 driver's instance structure as an input pointer
 * - The function returns a struct containing pointers to the virtual devices
 * - The hardware platform puts these virtual device pointers in the necessary
 *   locations so they can be accessed by application code (e.g., an API called
 *   get_temp0()).
 * - The full BME280 driver is hidden from the application, and only the virtual
 *   devices are exposed.
 *
 * @note This implementation _could_ support multiple implementations, but right
 * now it only supports one BME280 device in the system. To support multiple, this
 * basic approach would work, but you would need to duplicate the shim functions
 * by name to support the number of target implementations. You could add an index
 * input parameter to the initialize_bme280_virtual_devices() function so you can
 * access the correct set. Or you could manage the allocated count internally,
 * storing associated instance pointers in an array or list, and having implementations
 * map to a particular index in the list (temp0 => inst[0], temp1 => inst[1]).
